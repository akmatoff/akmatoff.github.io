Hello, I'm Azim, a web-developer and musician based in
Kyrgyzstan.

With 3 years of experience in web development, I specialize
in React and Next.js.

I have been studying programming since 2018, before I went to
college. By that time, I had started learning JavaScript, having
previously learned HTML and CSS. I realized I needed JavaScript to
advance, but I initially found it quite difficult to understand.
My understanding of programming improved later when I studied
Python at college.

I started my first job when I was almost 19, in February 2022. I
joined a startup based in Singapore as an intern, where I worked
for 2 years. During that time, I gained a lot of valuable
experience.

Currently, I am looking for new opportunities and trying to keep
improving.

When I'm not programming, I'm producing electronic music
in various genres and also love playing the guitar.
