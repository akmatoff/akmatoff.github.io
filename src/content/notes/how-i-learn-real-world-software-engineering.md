title: "From Tutorials to Production: How I Learn Real-World Software Engineering"

Tutorials teach the basics. Real-world software teaches you how messy things really are.

**Real apps are messy.**

- Migrations fail.
- Caches misbehave.
- Dependencies conflict.
- Local tests pass, production fails.

Tutorials don’t prepare you for this—but experience does.

## Sources of Deeper Knowledge

Through experience, I’ve developed strategies to tackle complex, real-world software:

**1. Experienced developers’ blogs**  
I focus on **less popular blogs** that dive into architecture, trade-offs, and production-level challenges. They show patterns and approaches tutorials skip.

**2. Open-source projects**  
Studying code, pull requests, and discussions in mature projects reveals how developers structure systems, handle edge cases, and refactor over time. These are lessons you won’t get from a course.

**3. AI as a tool**  
AI isn’t for copy-pasting solutions. I use it to **explore ideas, test approaches, and challenge assumptions**. By reasoning critically about AI suggestions, I often find faster or more creative solutions.

## My Approach to Learning

I mainly work with **TypeScript**, with some experience in **Python**. I’ve touched **frontend, backend, infrastructure, databases, DevOps, and product management**. Every messy project reinforces that software engineering is vast, complex, and constantly evolving.

The difference between junior and senior developers isn’t just knowing tools—it’s:

- **Depth of understanding**
- **Curiosity**
- **Questioning assumptions**

Every bug, system quirk, and messy piece of code is an opportunity to learn.

Software is messy — but that’s what makes it interesting. Keep learning, keep experimenting, and don’t shy away from complexity.
